And while she hasn't exhibited wide range as a singer, she's not here for that; she's here to construct a vibe.\" -Tara Mahadevan"

    bio: "Originally from St. Louis, she's released demos and loose singles throughout the years (as well as her Phases EP back in 2017) but her current focus is stronger than ever. Her newest offering, Moonflower, is a four song testament of rebirth that showcases her abilities both instrumentally and vocally. With reflective narratives of doubt, reassurances, and visible growth, the songstress crafts tracks that fit nicely next to a late night candle burning, a long cruise down a quiet road, a meditative afternoon with close friends. This is closure and self love in musical form. Loona Dae's sound is ambient and cosmic. It's a bright light when the world is shrouded in darkness."
