And while she hasn't exhibited wide range as a singer, she's not here for that; she's here to construct a vibe.\" -Tara Mahadevan"

The Chicago duo (by way of Kansas City) started making music together in high school and have steadily picked up speed and notoriety over the years. The two early twent-somethings (made up of Quinn Barlow on vocals/artwork and Quinn Cochrain on vocals/production) have fine-tuned their eclectic sound and grown deeply in their craft. Focusing on strong songwriting, organic production, and sharp instrumentation, the group properly blends a medley of genres that they call home. From soul to hip-hop to R&B to folk and beyond, it's in inimitable, signature style."

    bio: "Originally from St. Louis, she's released demos and loose singles throughout the years (as well as her Phases EP back in 2017) but her current focus is stronger than ever. Her newest offering, Moonflower, is a four song testament of rebirth that showcases her abilities both instrumentally and vocally. With reflective narratives of doubt, reassurances, and visible growth, the songstress crafts tracks that fit nicely next to a late night candle burning, a long cruise down a quiet road, a meditative afternoon with close friends. This is closure and self love in musical form. Loona Dae's sound is ambient and cosmic. It's a bright light when the world is shrouded in darkness."
